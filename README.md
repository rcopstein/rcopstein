I use this profile as both a place to store code I'm working on and as a portfolio for personal projects.
Below is a list (possibly incomplete) of projects here that you can have a look. I'll try to keep it up-to-date,
but your best bet is to navigate my list of open repositories.

### The Open Store (2020)

This is likely my biggest project to date. The Open Store is a full-stack application for an online store that integrates with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payment handling and [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) for email service. It is not complete and I would not recommend for production use before a good review.

The implementation is split among 4 separate repositories:

- [Server](https://github.com/rcopstein/open-store-server)
- [Client](https://github.com/rcopstein/open-store-client)
- [Database](https://github.com/rcopstein/open-store-database)
- [Deploy](https://github.com/rcopstein/open-store-deploy)

### Share (2019)

For my final project during my Bachelor's degree at PUCRS (Brazil) I attempted to develop a distributed file system for edge devices. In other words, it's a system that allows multiple machines to be configured in a group to share the task of storing a set of files. I did go very far with the implementation, but there are some bugs that need reviewing. It was written in C, so there are probably a lot of little things that went by unnoticed.

### Class Assignments

Throughout university I developed a myriad of systems for class assignments. Here are some of the highlights (in no particular order).

- [Paxos (2018)](https://github.com/rcopstein/Paxos) is a barebones implementation of the paxos protocol in Go
- [WAR with Agents (2018)](https://github.com/rcopstein/W.A.R-with-Agents) is a game of WAR implemented using the [JaCaMo](http://jacamo.sourceforge.net) framework
- [Graph Algorithms Visualizer (2017)](https://github.com/rcopstein/graph-algorithm-visualizer) is a system for visualizing the execution of graph algorithms
- [Universal Turing Machine (2017)](https://github.com/rcopstein/universal-turing-machine) is an implementation of a universal turing machine in [JFlap](http://www.jflap.org)
