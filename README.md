### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I use this profile as both a place to store code I'm working on and as a portfolio for personal projects.
Below is a list (possibly incomplete) of projects here that you can have a look. I'll try to keep it up-to-date,
but your best bet is to navigate my list of open repositories.

### The Open Store

This is likely my biggest project to date. The Open Store is a full-stack application for an online store that integrates with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payment handling and [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) for email service. It is not complete and I would not recommend for production use before a good review.

The implementation is split among 4 separate repositories:

- [Server](https://github.com/rcopstein/open-store-server)
- [Client](https://github.com/rcopstein/open-store-client)
- [Database](https://github.com/rcopstein/open-store-database)
- [Deploy](https://github.com/rcopstein/open-store-deploy)
